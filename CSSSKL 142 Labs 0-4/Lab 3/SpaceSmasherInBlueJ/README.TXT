To play with this game, compile and run the main(String[] args) from the Main.java class.

You only need to comment and uncomment one line inside of Main.java for each TODO, and this is just to set the TODO (runner) that youâ€™re working on.  

All work goes in each of the TODO.java files, respectively.
