# GTCS one-time setup script for Mac/Unix users
# This script will copy a needed library into a shared user library directory
# that is loaded automatically when blueJ starts up.
# Note that you may need to run this as an administrator if it fails to copy files

#First, set the working dir to be the one this script is located in
cd "${0%/*}"

echo "cd ${0%/*}"

cp  ./lib/SpaceSmasherLibrary.jar /Applications/BlueJ.app/Contents/Resources/Java/userlib
# Once the file is copied
open package.bluej
open README.TXT
